        <h4>Golf Clash</h4> 
        <p>Here is a look at the very first project I built with JavaScript. The inspiration behind this game came from my passion for sports. The technologies used to build this game include JavaScript (canvas), HTML, and CSS. Give it a try! </p>

        <h4>Data Benefits</h4>
        <p>The first project I built that included a backend JavaScript Framework, Express.js with authentication required. I was inspired to create this application so that users can see first-hand what data they are providing to companies, and allow them the opportunity to use that data to their benefit. </p>

        <h4 class="centerLongText">Inventory Management Assistant</h4>
        <p>A partner and I built this full-stack application designed to make it easier for business owners to manage their inventory and track their personnel. The technologies used include MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React.js. This taught me a lot about git and merging code, and also introduced me to my favorite JavaScript library, React.JS.</p>
